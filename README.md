Python scripts to generate QR codes and create cipherimages of any input image.

The Idea is to use 2by2.py to create two cipher images from an input image.
combination.py can be used to get the different output images based on the operations used. 

Looking to improve the amount of data that can be stored and encrypted on QR codes so that on reconstruction the data can be read by a scanner.
